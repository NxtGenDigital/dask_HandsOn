## DASK 
Dask is open source and freely available. 
Dask provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for the tools you love. 
It is developed in coordination with other community projects like Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

The syntax of Dask is the same as Pandas. It doesn’t take much time for you to get onboarded if you are familiar with Pandas. 
But, it’s not as simple as you think. You need to understand how Dask works and what are the functions or parameters that were implemented.
